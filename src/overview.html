                    This project provides simple API for handling Windows .ini configuration files.
		</p>
                
                <h3> Windows .ini file format </h3>
                <p>
                    Windows .ini files serve for saving the configuration of programs. They consist of sections, which are blocks of related properties. 
                    These properties are key-value pairs, with values of different type and arity. 
                    The values can be further restricted (e.g. it can only contain positive numbers), can contain comments, etc.
                    For bigger overview, we recommend you visiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.
                </p>
                
                <h3> Project overview </h3>
                <p> 
                    The project consists of 4 packages. All of them are prefixed with <i>cz.cuni.mff.d3s.pp.wininilib</i>.
                    The main package contains most important classes. These are:                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>IniFile: serves for specifying new format, loading existing configuration, accessing its internals as well as saving it back. </lI>
                        <li>Section: represents one section and provides methods to work with its properties</li>
                        <li>Property: represents one property and provides method to work with its key and values</li>
                        <li>Value: interface for all possible property values</li>
                        <li>ValueRestriction: interface for Value restrictions</li>
                    </ul>       
                    
                    Package <i>values</i> contains several implementations of <i>Value</i> interface (such as value for string, float or boolean).
                    Package <i>values.restrictions</i> then contains implementations of <i>ValueRestriction</i> interface; therefore classes, which check the validity of specific value.
                                
                    Finally, the last package <i>exceptions</i> contains all exceptions that are thrown by the library code.  
                </p>
                
                <h3>Compilation</h3>
                <p>
                    To compile the library, Java SDK >= 1.7.0. together with Apache Ant is required. Then these Ant tasks are available:
                    <ul>
                    <li>compile: compiles all sources (into out/classes folder )</li>
                    <li>refdoc: creates project documentation (in out/javadoc)</li>
                    <li>create-jar: creates jar file of the library (out/jars)</li>
                    <li>main: performs all previous tasks</li>
                                        
                    </ul>
                </p>
                                
                <h3> Demo examples </h3>                
                <p>
                    The most common tasks, user will use this library for are:
                    <h4> Define own format of .ini file</h4>
                    
                    <h4> Load .ini file, check it against specified format, modify it and save back</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To get more familiar with the library, we suggest you to inspect sample demo code, which is located in ExampleUsage java file.
